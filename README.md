# Credit Default Web App deployed on Heroku

The deployed web app is live at https://credit--default.herokuapp.com/

This web app predicts whether a customer will default in the following month or not as a function of the input parameters (education, balance limit, age, marriage, previous month payment, bill amounts & pay amounts).

For accounts which tend to Not Default, Credit Counseling is recommended.

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:
* streamlit
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* joblib
